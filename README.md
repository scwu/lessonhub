# _LessonHub_

_Description: We made a Github for teachers - encouraging collaboration for teachers and increasing the efficiency of lesson plans._

## Project Setup

_How do I, as a developer, start working on the project?_ 

1. _Flask, MongoDB, and BackboneJS._
2. _Use our requirements.txt and install it with pip_
3. _`pip install -r requirements.txt`_
4. _`mongo` (make sure you ran `mongod` first to start the server._
5. _In the mongo client type `use lessonhub`_
6. _Run `python runserver.py`


## Features

1. Creating curriculums for each user (equivalent to a class)
2. Creating lesson plans within that curriculum in a linear way (insert the lesson plan anywhere on the page)
3. Searching globally for anyone else's plan 
4. Copying someone else's and "forking it" as your won.
4. Editting both your own and the "forked" lesson plan to accomodate your needs in rich text format.

## Future Features/Bugs

### _Bugs_

- _Insertion into linear space doesn't always return/insert in the correct order (issue with the API)_
- _Permissions not restrictive - not checking in the backend whether the user has permissions to edit there._
- _Lesson links don't work_
-_Followers/Following doesn't do anything_

### _Future Features_
